ðŸ§­ Two Pointers â€“ LeetCode Solutions

This folder contains my LeetCode solutions for problems that use the Two Pointers algorithmic technique.
Each solution is implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind, often including explanations or comments to describe the thought process behind the approach.

ðŸ“š What is the Two Pointers Technique?

The Two Pointers technique is a fundamental algorithm pattern used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists.
It involves using two indices (pointers) to iterate through the data structureâ€”either from both ends or with one leading the otherâ€”to optimize time and space complexity.

Common problem types solved using this approach include:

Pair-sum problems (e.g. Two Sum II, 3Sum)

Removing or filtering elements in-place

Reversing parts of arrays or strings

Merging sorted arrays/lists

Sliding window optimizations
