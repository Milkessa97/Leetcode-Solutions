🌬️ Sliding Window – LeetCode Solutions

This folder contains my LeetCode solutions for problems that use the Sliding Window technique.
Each solution focuses on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code to strengthen algorithmic thinking and optimize performance.

📚 What is the Sliding Window Technique?

The Sliding Window technique is a powerful pattern used to solve problems involving subarrays, substrings, or sequences.
It involves maintaining a “window” (a subset of elements) that slides across the input data — expanding or shrinking depending on problem constraints — to avoid redundant computations.

Common problem types include:

Finding maximum/minimum sum subarrays

Longest/shortest substrings with certain properties

Counting or optimizing values within a range

Pattern matching and frequency tracking
